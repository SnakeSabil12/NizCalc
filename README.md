# NizCalc

## Overview
Hello There! I am Sabil Islam
I made this calculator application at the age of 9 with the help of Python, TCL and TKinter. Back then, I just started programming and in the same time I was getting interested towards advanced mathematical problems. I was having trouble using Microsoft Calculator, so I thought that, "why don't I make my own one!" So I started making my own calculator and made one in 3 months. 
I learned a lot while making this calculator. I learned about the basics of GUI programming and the basic mechanics of GUI applications. It was a really fun project to do for a 9 year old kid. I realized the beauty of of mathematics while making this; I quit complaining about other applications as I found that developing an application is not an easy task. It increased my respect for software engineers a lot of times. 

## Description 
NizCalc is a regular calculator application. It can be used to perform regular tasks. The calculator have both simple and scientific mode. I also contains Trigonometric functions, Inverse Trigonometric functions, Hyperbola Trigonometric functions and Inverse Hyperbola Trigonometric functions. There is also a unit to unit conversion mode. I also included the L.C.M and H.C.F finding as I found that it is missing in most of the calculators I use. \
I used Python and TKinter for this application. I used Python and TKinter as they are beginner friendly and back the when I was developing this application, I was a complete beginner. But Python is a vert powerful programming language to work with as it is really very versatile. And for calculator, I like a clean and simple GUI so I used TKinter.\
I want to some features like dynamic unit to unit conversion and currency conversion in future as I am now really busy with other projects and I don't think that I now remember most of the code. \
