# NizCalc

## Overview
Hello There! I am Sabil Islam\
I made this calculator application at the age of 9 with the help of Python, TCL and TKinter. Back then, I just started programming and in the same time I was getting interested towards mathematics. I was having trouble using Microsoft Calculator, so I thought that, "why don't I make my own one!" So I started making my own calculator and made one in 3 months. \
I learned a lot while making this calculator. I learned about the basics of GUI programming and the basic mechanics of GUI applications. It was a really fun project to do for a 9 year old kid. I realized the beauty of of mathematics while making this; I quit complaining about other applications as I found that developing an application is not an easy task. It increased my respect for software engineers a lot of times. 

## Description 
NizCalc is a regular calculator application. It can be used to perform regular tasks. The calculator have both simple and scientific mode. I also contains Trigonometric functions, Inverse Trigonometric functions, Hyperbola Trigonometric functions and Inverse Hyperbola Trigonometric functions. There is also a unit to unit conversion mode. I also included the L.C.M and H.C.F finding as I found that it is missing in most of the calculators I use. \
I used Python and TKinter for this application. I used Python and TKinter as they are beginner friendly and back the when I was developing this application, I was a complete beginner. But Python is a vert powerful programming language to work with as it is really very versatile. And for calculator, I like a clean and simple GUI so I used TKinter.\
I want to some features like dynamic unit to unit conversion and currency conversion in future as I am now really busy with other projects and I don't think that I now remember most of the code. 

## Installation
If somehow you want to install it in your own machine, make sure that you are running a Windows machine or else it may throw a bunch a errors as I did not tested the application in any other Operating system other than Windows.\
If you want to simply install it in windows, just download the `Nizpad Setup.exe` file and run it. It is the installer for the full application.\
If you just want the `.exe` or the files of exe, then have a look in `-onedir` for the files and `-onefile` for only the executable\
And if you are curious about how this application works, then have a look in the `Source Code` folder. All the source code used for this application is sitting right there.

## Credits
Obviously I did not made this on my own, I followed a bunch of tutorials and documentations. 
I mostly followed the **TKinter Playlist** of **Codemy.com** in YouTube. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQSEXcf6s2I&list=PLCC34OHNcOtoC6GglhF3ncJ5rLwQrLGnV \
His channel contains a lot of good stuffs. Make sure to follow his channel if you are learning TKinter. He really got some cool stuff there.
